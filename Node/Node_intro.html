                <p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for
                    almost any kind of project!</p>

                <p>Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows
                    Node.js to be very performant.</p>

            <div class="answer" id="answer2">
                <p>V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. It's the thing that takes our
                    JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome. V8 is the JavaScript engine i.e. it parses
                    and executes JavaScript code.</p>

            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">Q. 3 Why node-js is used?</div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer3">
                <p>Node.js is an open source, a server-side script which runs on the top of Google’s open-source
                    scripting engine V8. Node.js is fast, lightweight and efficient. It uses the asynchronous mode of
                    operation, event-driven Input/Output rather than using the traditional threads or separate threads
                    for each process. Node.js was originally written by Ryan Dahl in the year 2009. It is a
                    cross-platform Javascript run-time environment that executes Javascript code outside of a browser.
                    Node.js uses javascript for creating node applications or we can use any other language that
                    ultimately compiles to javascript (like typescript). The javascript is written in the same way as
                    we’d use in any client-side application. However, we need to set up the node development
                    environment.</p>

        <div class="qa-item">
            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">Q. 4 Introduction to nodejs</div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer4">
                <p> Node.js is a powerful, open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows
                    developers to
                    build scalable and high-performance web applications. Originally created by Ryan Dahl in 2009,
                    Node.js
                    has since become one of the most popular frameworks for building server-side applications,
                    particularly
                    for real-time web applications and APIs.</p>

                <p>Here's a basic introduction to Node.js:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>JavaScript Runtime:</b> Node.js allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the
                        server-side, outside the
                        confines of a web browser. This means that developers can use JavaScript for both client-side
                        and
                        server-side development, providing a more consistent and seamless development experience.</li>

                    <li><b>Event-Driven Architecture:</b> Node.js is built on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model,
                        which means that
                        it is highly efficient and can handle a large number of concurrent connections without the need
                        for
                        threading. This makes Node.js particularly well-suited for building real-time applications, such
                        as chat
                        applications or multiplayer games.</li>

                    <li><b>V8 JavaScript Engine:</b> Node.js is powered by the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same
                        engine used by
                        Google Chrome. This engine compiles JavaScript code into machine code, allowing Node.js to
                        execute
                        JavaScript code with impressive speed and efficiency.</li>

                    <li><b>NPM (Node Package Manager):</b> NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, providing
                        access to a vast
                        ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools that can be easily integrated into Node.js
                        projects. This
                        makes it easy for developers to leverage existing code and accelerate the development process.
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Single-Threaded, Non-Blocking:</b> Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop architecture,
                        which means that
                        it can handle multiple requests concurrently without spawning additional threads. This makes it
                        lightweight and efficient, particularly for I/O-heavy applications.</li>

                    <li><b>Cross-Platform:</b> Node.js is cross-platform, meaning that it can run on various operating
                        systems,
                        including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes it versatile and accessible for developers
                        working on
                        different platforms.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="answer" id="answer5">

                <ul>
                    <li>Node.js 0.10.x: This was one of the early stable versions of Node.js, featuring basic
                        capabilities for
                        building server-side applications.</li>

                    <li> Node.js 0.12.x: This version introduced significant improvements and features, including better
                        Windows
                        support, performance enhancements, and updates to the V8 engine.</li>

                    <li> Node.js 4.x (LTS): Node.js 4.x was the first version to follow the Long-Term Support (LTS)
                        schedule,
                        which meant it received maintenance updates and security fixes for an extended period. It
                        included
                        significant updates to JavaScript language features and improvements to core modules.</li>

                    <li>Node.js 6.x (LTS): Building upon the foundation of Node.js 4.x, version 6.x brought even more
                        stability,
                        performance improvements, and new features. It also marked the beginning of a regular release
                        cycle for
                        LTS versions.</li>

                    <li>Node.js 8.x (LTS): Node.js 8.x introduced several important features, including async/await
                        support,
                        improvements to the npm package manager, and enhancements to the core APIs.</li>

                    <li> Node.js 10.x (LTS): This version included updates to the V8 engine, performance improvements,
                        and new
                        features such as N-API (a stable Node.js API for native modules) and HTTP/2 support.</li>

                    <li>Node.js 12.x (LTS): Node.js 12.x continued to improve performance and stability while
                        introducing
                        features like ES6 module support, TLS improvements, and enhancements to the Worker Threads API
                        for
                        multithreading.</li>

                    <li>Node.js 14.x (LTS): Node.js 14.x brought significant improvements to diagnostic reporting,
                        better
                        support for ECMAScript modules (ESM), and updates to the V8 engine.</li>

                    <li> Node.js 16.x (LTS): The latest LTS version as of my last update, Node.js 16.x, continued to
                        refine
                        performance, stability, and developer experience. It included features like improved ECMAScript
                        module
                        support, updated npm, and better diagnostics.</li>

                    supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later
