        <li>
            <h3>What are the benefits of using CSS?</h3>
        </li>
        <p><b>-Separation of Content and Style</b><br>
            One of the most significant advantages of CSS is its ability to separate content from presentation. This
            separation enhances the maintainability of web pages as changes to the styling can be made without altering
            the underlying HTML structure. This also promotes a cleaner, more organized codebase.</p>
        <p><b>-Consistency</b><br>CSS enables consistent styling across an entire website or multiple pages. This is one
            of
            the many advantages of using CSS. By creating a single external CSS file and linking it to multiple web
            pages, you ensure a uniform look and feel. This reduces redundancy and makes it easier to update styling
            elements globally.</p>
        <p><b>-Faster Loading Times</b><br>External CSS files can be cached by web browsers, allowing them to load
            faster on
            subsequent visits. This results in a better user experience, especially for returning visitors.</p>
        <p><b>-Responsive Design</b><br>With CSS, you can create responsive web designs that adapt to different screen
            sizes
            and devices. This is another main one among advantages of cascading style sheets. This is crucial in the era
            of mobile browsing, as it ensures your website looks and functions well on various platforms.</p>
        <p><b>- Ease of Maintenance</b><br>Modifying the appearance of a website is more straightforward with CSS. You
            can quickly make changes to fonts, colors, and layouts by updating a few lines of code in the CSS file,
            rather than manually editing each HTML element. </p>
        <p><b>-Accessibility</b><br>CSS allows developers to improve web accessibility by controlling the presentation
            of content. Properly structured CSS can make a website more accessible to individuals with disabilities,
            enhancing inclusivity.</p>
        <p><b>-Animations and Effects</b><br>CSS allows for animations and transitions, enhancing the user experience.
            You can create interactive elements without relying on JavaScript or other scripting languages. </p>

            <h3>What are the disadvantages of CSS?
            </h3>
        </li>
        <p><b>-Browser Compatibility</b><br>CSS may render differently in various web browsers, leading to
            inconsistencies in the visual presentation. Developers often need to write browser-specific CSS code or use
            vendor prefixes to ensure compatibility. </p>
        <p><b>-Learning Curve</b><br>One among the main disadvantages of cascading style sheets is that while it is
            essential for web development, it can be complex, especially for beginners. Mastering CSS requires
            understanding selectors, properties, values, and the box model, which can be overwhelming. </p>
        <p><b>-Lack of Security</b><br>CSS itself does not offer security features, and it can be vulnerable to attacks
            like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when used inappropriately. Developers must be cautious when implementing CSS
            to prevent security risks. </p>
        <p><b>-Maintenance Challenges</b><br>As websites grow and evolve, maintaining and refactoring CSS can become
            complex and time-consuming. It's crucial to follow best practices and use naming conventions to keep styles
            manageable. </p>

            <h3> Name a few CSS style components</h3>
        </li>
        <p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components: <br>
            -Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify.
            For example, font-size, width, background-color. <br>
            -Values: Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property. <br>
            The example below highlights a single property and value. The property name is color and the value is blue.

            <h3>What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h3>
        </li>
        <p>The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an
            element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.
            <br>
            A <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> in the range 0.0 to 1.0, inclusive, or a <code>&lt;percentage&gt;</code> in
            the range 0% to 100%, inclusive,
            representing the opacity of the channel (that is, the value of its alpha channel). Any value outside
            the interval, though valid, is clamped to the nearest limit in the range.
            <br>
        <table border="1">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Value</th>
                    <th>Meaning</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>0</code></td>
                    <td>The element is fully transparent (that is, invisible).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Any <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number"><code>&lt;number&gt;</code></a> strictly <br> between
                        <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>
                    </td>
                    <td>The element is translucent (that is, content behind the element can be seen).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>1</code> (default value)</td>
                    <td>The element is fully opaque (visually solid).</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <br>

            <h3> How can the background color of an element be changed?
            </h3>
        </li>
        <p>The background-color property of CSS is used to set the background of an element. We can set background color
            by selecting the element by its class name of id name and then apply the background-color property on it to
            set the background color.
            <br>
            Example: p {
            background-color: pink;
            }
        </p>
        <hr>
        <li>
            <h3>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?
            </h3>
        </li>
        <p>This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition
            of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally
            and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.
            <br>
            <b>Syntax</b> : background-repeat: repeat|repeat-x|repeat-y|no-repeat|initial|inherit;<br>
            <b>Example :</b> <br> background-image: url(
            "https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/geeks-25.png");<br>
            background-repeat: repeat-x;<br>
            background-size: 150px 100px;
        </p>
        <hr>
        <li>
            <h3>What is the use of the background-position property?</h3>
        </li>
        <p>The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each background image. The position is
            relative to the position layer set by background-origin.
            <br><b>Syntax:</b>
            background-position: value;
        <ul>
            <li><strong>background-position: left top:</strong> This property is used to set the image at the left top.
            </li>
            <li><strong>background-position: left center :</strong>This property is used to set the image at the left
                center.</li>
            <li><strong>background-position: left bottom;</strong> This property is used to set the image at the left
                bottom.</li>
            <li><strong>background-position: center top;</strong> This property is used to set the image at the center
                top position.</li>
            <li><strong>background-position: center center;</strong> This property is used to set the image at the
                center center position.</li>
            <li><strong>background-position: center bottom;</strong> This property is used to set the image at the
                center bottom position.</li>
            <li><strong>background-position: right top;</strong> This property is used to set the image at the right top
                position.</li>
            <li><strong>background-position: right center;</strong> This property is used to set the image at the right
                center position.</li>
            <li><strong>background-position: right bottom;</strong> This property is used to set the image at the right
                bottom position.</li>
            <li><strong>background-position: 25% 75%:</strong> This property is used to set the image at 25% from the
                left and 75% from the top.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> For x%y% notation, here x% denotes the horizontal position &amp; y%
                        denotes the vertical position with respect to the initial position i.e, left top.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>background-position: 30px 80px;</strong>: This property is used to set the image at the 30px
                from left and 80px from top.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Note</strong>: For x-pos y-pos notation, here the units are represented in pixels or any
                        other CSS units.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Which property controls the image scroll in the background?
            </h3>
        </li>
        <p>The background-attachment property in CSS is used to specify the kind of attachment of the background image
            with respect to its container. It can be set to scroll or make it remain fixed. It can be applied to all
            HTML elements.
            <br>
            <b>Syntax:</b>
            background-attachment: scroll|fixed|local|initial|inherit;
            <br>
            <b>Example:</b> <br>
            #example { <br>
            background-image:
            url("https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/geeks-25.png"); <br>
            background-position: center; <br>

            <h3>Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h3>
        </li>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>color is referring to the text color in that element.</li>
            <br>
            <li>background-color refers to the background color</li>
            <br>
            <li>background is shorthand to combine many background tags into one line.
            </li><br>

            <h3>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h3>
        </li>

        <p>There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
            <br>
            -External CSS <br>
            -Internal CSS <br>
            -Inline CSS <br>
            <b>External CSS</b><br>
            With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
            <br>
            Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the &lt;link&gt; element,
            inside the head section.
            <br>
            <b>Example : </b>
            External styles are defined within the
            &lt;link&gt; element, inside the

            &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML page: <br>
            <code>&lt;head&gt;
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
            </code>
            <br>
            <b>Internal CSS</b><br>
            An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
            <br>
            The internal style is defined inside the &lt;style&gt;ss element, inside the head section.
            <br>
            <b>Example</b>
            Internal styles are defined within the &lt;style&gt; element, inside the

            <head> section of an HTML page:<br>
                <code>
                &lt;head&gt;
                    &lt;style&gt;
                    body {
                      background-color: linen;
                    }
                    
                    h1 {
                      color: maroon;
                      margin-left: 40px;
                    }
                    &lt;/style&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
            </code>
                <br>
                <b>Inline CSS</b><br>
                An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
                <br>
                To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain
                any CSS. <br>
                <b>Example</b><br>
                <code>
                    &lt;h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;"&gt;This is a heading&lt;h1&gt;<br>
                    &lt;p style="color:red;"&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <li>
            <h3>What is embedded style sheets?</h3>
        </li>
        <p><b>Embedded Stylesheet:</b><br> It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in
            one place. This is done by embedding the &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tags containing the CSS properties in
            the head of your document. Embedded style sheets are particularly useful for HTML documents that have unique
            style requirements from the rest of the documents in your project. However, if the styles need to be applied
            across multiple documents, you should link to an external style sheet instead of using individual embedded
            style sheets. Using embedded stylesheets holds a distinct advantage over inline styles which only allow you
            to address one HTML element at a time.
            <br>
            <b>Syntax:</b><br> The CSS syntax for embedded style sheets is exactly the same as other CSS code, apart
            from the fact that it is now wrapped within the &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tags. The &lt;style&gt; tag
            takes the ‘type’ attribute that defines the type of style sheet being used (ie. text/CSS).
            <br>
            <code>
                &lt;head&gt;
                    &lt;style&gt;
                    body {
                      background-color: linen;
                    }
                    
                    h1 {
                      color: maroon;
                      margin-left: 40px;
                    }
                    &lt;/style&gt;

            With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
            <br>
            Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the &lt;link&gt; element,
            inside the head section.
            <br>
            <b>Example : </b>
            External styles are defined within the
            &lt;link&gt; element, inside the

            &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML page: <br>
            <code>&lt;head&gt;
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
            </code>
