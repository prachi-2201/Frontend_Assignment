            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(1)">Q.1 What are the advantages of Bootstrap?
            </div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer1">
                Bootstrap offers several advantages for web development:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Responsive Design:</b> Bootstrap's grid system allows developers to create responsive layouts
                        easily. This means websites built with Bootstrap can adapt to various screen sizes and devices,
                        providing a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>
                    <li><b>Pre-styled Components:</b> Bootstrap comes with a wide range of pre-styled components such as
                        buttons, forms, navigation bars, and more. These components are customizable and can be easily
                        integrated into web projects, saving developers time and effort in designing and styling common
                        UI elements.</li>
                    <li><b>Cross-browser Compatibility:</b> Bootstrap is designed to be compatible with major web
                        browsers,
                        ensuring that websites built with Bootstrap will look and function consistently across different
                        browsers and platforms.</li>
                    <li><b>Documentation and Community Support:</b> Bootstrap has extensive documentation and a large
                        community
                        of developers. This makes it easy for developers to learn and use Bootstrap, as well as find
                        solutions to common problems and get support from the community.</li>
                    <li><b>Customizable and Extendable:</b> While Bootstrap provides ready-to-use components and styles
                        out of
                        the box, it is also highly customizable and extendable. Developers can easily customize
                        Bootstrap's CSS or use the SASS variables to tailor the framework to their specific needs.
                        Additionally, Bootstrap can be integrated with other front-end frameworks and libraries,
                        allowing for even more flexibility in web development.</li>
                    <li><b>Consistency and Efficiency:</b> By using Bootstrap, developers can maintain consistency in
                        design
                        and functionality across different projects or pages within a project. This consistency not only
                        improves the user experience but also makes it easier for developers to maintain and update
                        websites over time.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="qa-item">
            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">Q.2 What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?
            </div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer2">
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Fixed-width Container:</b> By default, Bootstrap containers have a fixed width, which means
                        they have a maximum width set to a specific value (such as 1140 pixels). This fixed width helps
                        to maintain consistent spacing and alignment of content across different screen sizes.</li>
                    <li><b>Centered Content:</b> The container class in Bootstrap automatically centers the content
                        within the
                        container horizontally. This means that the content will be visually centered on the page,
                        regardless of the screen size or resolution.</li>
                    <li><b>Responsive Design:</b> Bootstrap containers are designed to be responsive, meaning they
                        adjust their
                        width based on the viewport size. This allows content to adapt to various screen sizes, from
                        large desktop monitors to mobile devices.</li>
                    <li><b>Padding and Margin:</b> Bootstrap containers also include padding on the left and right sides
                        to
                        create space between the content and the edges of the container. This padding helps to improve
                        readability and aesthetics.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">Q.3 What are the default Bootstrap textsettings?</div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer3">
                Bootstrap provides default text settings to ensure consistency and readability across different
                elements. These settings include default font family, font size, line height, and text color. Here are
                the default Bootstrap text settings:
                <br>
                <b>-Font Family:</b> The default font family used in Bootstrap is a system font stack that prioritizes
                Helvetica
                Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. This font stack ensures that text is displayed consistently across
                different operating systems and devices.
                <br>
                <b>-Font Size:</b> By default, Bootstrap uses a base font size of 16 pixels (1 rem). It also defines
                relative
                font sizes for various elements such as headings, paragraphs, and other text elements using a modular
                scale.
                <br>
                <b>-Line Height:</b> Bootstrap sets a default line height of 1.5 for body text and 1.2 for headings.
                This line
                height ensures appropriate spacing between lines of text, improving readability and aesthetics.
                <br>
                <b>-Text Color:</b> Bootstrap sets the default text color to a dark gray (#212529) for body text and
                headings.
                It also defines additional text color classes for displaying text in different colors (e.g.,
                text-primary, text-secondary, text-success, etc.).
                <br>
                These default text settings can be customized using Bootstrap's utility classes or by overriding the
                default styles with custom CSS. Developers can adjust font family, font size, line height, and text
                color to match the design requirements of their project while still maintaining the overall Bootstrap
                aesthetic and responsiveness.

        <div class="qa-item">
            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">Q.4 What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer4">
                The Bootstrap Grid System is a powerful and flexible layout system provided by the Bootstrap framework
                for building responsive and mobile-first websites. It consists of a 12-column grid system that allows
                developers to create complex and responsive layouts with ease. Here's what you need to know about the
                Bootstrap Grid System:
                <ul>

                    <li><b>12-Column Grid:</b> The Bootstrap Grid System is based on a 12-column layout grid. Each row
                        in the grid is divided into 12 equal-width columns, providing developers with a flexible and
                        modular grid structure for organizing content.</li>

                    <li><b>Responsive Design:</b> Bootstrap's Grid System is designed to be responsive, meaning it
                        automatically adjusts the layout and column widths based on the viewport size. This ensures that
                        websites built with Bootstrap look and function well on various devices and screen sizes,
                        including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>

                    <li><b>Grid Classes:</b> Bootstrap provides a set of grid classes to define the layout of elements
                        within
                        the grid system. These classes include .container, .container-fluid, .row, and column classes
                        such as .col-, .col-sm-, .col-md-, .col-lg-, and .col-xl-. Developers can use these classes to
                        create responsive layouts and specify the width of columns at different breakpoints (extra
                        small, small, medium, large, and extra large).</li>

                    <li><b>Offsetting Columns:</b> In addition to specifying column widths, Bootstrap allows developers
                        to
                        offset columns within a row using offset classes such as .offset-, .offset-sm-, .offset-md-,
                        .offset-lg-, and .offset-xl-. This allows for finer control over the layout and alignment of
                        elements within the grid system.</li>
                    <li><b>Nested Grids:</b> Bootstrap supports nesting grids within columns, allowing developers to
                        create
                        complex and nested layouts. This means you can place rows and columns within columns to create
                        more sophisticated designs.</li>
                    <li><b>Alignment and Ordering:</b> Bootstrap provides utility classes for aligning and ordering
                        columns
                        within a row. These classes include .justify-content-start, .justify-content-center,
                        .justify-content-end, .align-items-start, .align-items-center, .align-items-end, .order-first,
                        .order-last, and .order-1 through .order-12.</li>
                    <li><b>Utility Classes:</b> Bootstrap includes a variety of utility classes that allow developers to
                        apply
                        spacing, alignment, visibility, and other styles directly to elements within the grid system,
                        making it easy to customize the layout and appearance of elements.</li>
                </ul>

                “Button Groups” in Bootstrap is a class of name “btn-group” which is used to create a series of buttons

            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">Q.7 In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?
            </div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer7">
                The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead
                of floats, to handle the layout.
                <br>
                The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without
                using float or positioning.
                <br>
                Here are some key aspects of Flexbox in Bootstrap 4:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Container and Items:</b> In Flexbox, there are container elements and their child items. The
                        container's direct children become flex items, and they are laid out within the container
                        according to the Flexbox rules.</li>
                    <li><b>Flex Direction:</b> The flex-direction property determines the main axis along which flex
                        items are
                        laid out. In Bootstrap 4, the default flex direction for most components is row, meaning items
                        are laid out horizontally. However, it can be changed to column if needed.</li>
                    <li><b>Flex Wrap:</b> The flex-wrap property controls whether flex items are forced onto a single
                        line or
                        can wrap onto multiple lines within the container. Bootstrap 4 utilizes flex-wrap: wrap by
                        default to allow items to wrap onto new lines when necessary.</li>
                    <li><b>Alignment:</b> Flexbox provides powerful alignment capabilities for both the main axis
                        (horizontal
                        alignment) and the cross axis (vertical alignment). Bootstrap 4 includes utility classes such as
                        justify-content-* and align-items-* to control alignment within flex containers.</li>
                    <li><b>Flex Grow and Shrink:</b> Flexbox allows flex items to grow or shrink to fill available space
                        within
                        the flex container. Bootstrap 4 utilizes the flex-grow and flex-shrink properties to control how
                        items resize relative to each other.</li>
                    <li><b>Flex Order:</b> Flexbox enables reordering of flex items using the order property. Bootstrap
                        4
                        provides utility classes like order-* to easily change the visual order of elements within a
                        flex container without changing their source order.</li>
                </ol>
